# WebApi2 Study
The new and improved BeerDev using WebApi 2 and Bootstrap.

In the 70-480 exam study I built the first version of the BeerDev store. Not I rebuilt it using the WebAPi 2 to handle REST calls and use the bootstrap to simplify the layout design. I also refactor some javascript functionalities for the project to be more cohesive.
